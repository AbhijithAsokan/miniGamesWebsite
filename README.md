# miniGamesWebsite

A website with small games like "Snakes".
I made this for a practice while studying django.
Most of Django specific work of the project is done in registration app.

Snake game is completely done in JavaScript and make some clever use of DOM structure.
For Dynamic LeaderBoard for Snake Game, AJAX is used.

FontAwesome,Bootstap static files are recieved through CDN, to reduce load on server.

Working version of this project is currently online. Visit : - http://minigameswebsite-abhijithasokan.rhcloud.com/
