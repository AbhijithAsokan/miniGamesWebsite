# miniGamesWebsite

A website with small games like "Snakes".
I made this while studying django for a practice.
Most of Django specific work on the project in done in registration app.

Snake game is completely done in JavaScript and make some clever use of DOM structure.
I have done 2 Django apps for registration and Game.
For Dynamic LeaderBoard for Snake Game , i have used AJAX.

FontAwesome,Bootstap static files are recieved through CDN, to reduce load on server.

Working version of this project is currently online. Visit : - http://minigameswebsite-abhijithasokan.rhcloud.com/
